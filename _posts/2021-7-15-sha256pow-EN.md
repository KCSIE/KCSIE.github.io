# SHA and Python

## SHA

Secure Hash Algorithm(SHA) is a family of cryptographic hash functions, which is able to calculate a digital message corresponds to a fixed length string (also known as the message digest). It is a one-way function to facilitate the calculation, with confidentiality and integrity. Hash functions have the important features of consistency, compression, lossiness, and collision resistance, preimage resistance and secondary preimage resistance. Commonly used hash cryptographic functions include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-3-256.

## Hashlib & SHA256

SHA can be used in various applications, such as account passwords, etc. Python supports various SHA algorithms through the Hashlib library, and the commonly used SHA256 will be introduced below as an example.

We can use the relevant hash functions by importing Hashlib, which includes SHA256, SHA384, SHA224, SHA512, SHA1, MD5. SHA256 belongs to SHA-2, for any length of message SHA256 will generate a 256-bit hash value called message digest. The digest is equivalent to an array of 32 bytes in length, usually represented by a hexadecimal string of 64 bits in length, where 1 byte = 8 bits and the length of a hexadecimal character is 4 bits. For example, the result of abc after SHA256 is ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad.

```python
# SHA256
import hashlib
  
# initializing string
str = "abc"
  
# encoding 'abc' using encode() then sending to SHA256()
result = hashlib.sha256(str.encode())
  
# printing the equivalent hexadecimal value.
print("The hexadecimal equivalent of SHA256 is : ")
print(result.hexdigest())
```



# Proof of Work

## Consensus mechanism

The consensus mechanism is to verify and validate a transaction in a very short time through the voting of special nodes. If several nodes with unrelated interests can reach consensus on a transaction, we can assume that the whole network can also reach consensus on it. 

Blockchain as a decentralized distributed ledger system, in order to ensure the effective operation of the whole system each node can honestly record, in the absence of a center, a sufficient condition for each node to reach agreement among individuals who do not trust each other is that each node, out of consideration for maximizing its own interests, will spontaneously and honestly comply with the predetermined rules in the agreement, judge the authenticity of each record, and finally post the record which is judged to be true into blockchain. 

Today's mainstream consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (POW), Proof of Stake (POS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), POOL, etc.

## POW

Proof of workload is simply a metric set by the system to achieve a certain goal, which is simply a proof used to confirm that you have done a certain amount of work. In a blockchain network built on a proof-of-work mechanism, the ability of nodes to compete for ledger rights by computing random hash value solutions to find the correct values to generate blocks is a practical representation of the nodes' computational power.

For example, given a basic string, the work requirement is that we can add an integer value called nonce to the string, perform a SHA256 hash on the merged string, and if the resulting hash (in hexadecimal form) starts with "0000", then the verification passes. In order to achieve this goal of workload proof. We need to keep incrementing the nonce value and perform SHA256 hashing on the new string. According to this rule, we need to go through several calculations to find the hash hash with exactly the first 4 bits being 0.

## POW in Bitcoin

### Block

A bitcoin block consists of a block header and a block body containing a list of transactions. The block header is 80 bytes in size and consists of a 4-byte version number, a 32-byte hash of the parent block header, a 32-byte Merkle root hash, a 4-byte timestamp (current time), a 4-byte current difficulty value, and a 4-byte random number. The block body is then appended to the block header, where the first transaction is a coinbase transaction, a special transaction for miners to receive a reward and a fee.

The block header is specified as follows.

- Version: block version number, indicating the validation rules followed by this block, 4 bytes
- Prev Hash: the hash of the previous block, calculated using SHA256, accounting for 32 bytes
- Merkle Hash: the hash of the Merkle root of the transaction in the block, also calculated using SHA256, accounting for 32 bytes
- Timestamp: the approximate time generated by the block, accurate to the second UNIX timestamp, must be strictly greater than the median of the first 11 block times, while the full node also rejects blocks that exceed its own 2-hour timestamp, accounting for 4 bytes
- Bits: the difficulty target of the proof of work algorithm for the block, which has been encoded using a specific algorithm, accounting for 4 bytes
- Nonce: in order to find the random number set to meet the difficulty target, and to solve the problem that 32-bit random numbers are not enough in the case of soaring arithmetic power, the timestamp and coinbase transaction information can be changed to extend the number of bits of nonce, accounting for 4 bytes

In order to make the block header embody all the transactions contained in the block, the list of transactions to be contained in the block is to be generated as a Merkle root hash by the Merkle Tree algorithm during the construction of the block, which has the following structure.

### Difficulty

The difficulty value is an important reference indicator for miners when mining, and it determines approximately how many hash operations a miner needs to go through to generate a legitimate block. The Bitcoin network's difficulty value is constantly changing, it is guaranteed to generate a block approximately every 10 minutes, and the difficulty value is adjusted every 2016 (actually 2015) blocks: if the average block generation time is less than 10 minutes, it means that the network-wide computing power increases and the difficulty value increases, if the average block generation time is greater than 10 minutes, it means that the network-wide computing power decreases and the difficulty value decreases. Therefore, the difficulty value is dynamically adjusted as the network-wide computing power increases or decreases, so that the rate of new block generation is always maintained at about one block per 10 minutes.

The specific formula is as follows.

> Difficulty adjustment formula: New Difficulty = Old Difficulty * ( The Time Last 2016 Blocks Spent / 20160 Minutes )

> Target = Maximum Target / Current Difficulty
>
> The length of the Maximum Target is 256 bits, the first 32 bits are 0 and then all are 1, which are generally displayed as HASH values: 0x00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

The size of the Target is inversely proportional to the difficulty value, and a Bitcoin proof of work is reached when the block hash calculated by the miner must be smaller than the Target value.

### Process

1. Generate Coinbase transactions and form a transaction list with all other transactions ready to be packed into the block, and generate the Merkle root hash by the Merkle Tree algorithm.
2. Padding other block header fields, using the 80 bytes of data in the block header as input to the proof of work.
3. Constantly change the random number in the block header, i.e., the value of nonce, and do double SHA256 operation on the block header after each change, i.e., SHA256(SHA256(Block_Header)), compare the result value with the target value of the current network, if it is less than the target value and meets the difficulty, the solution is successful and the proof of work is completed, if it does not meet the difficulty, then change the nonce according to certain strategy and then do the Hash operation and verify it.

# Mining

## Mining Principle

To sum up, mining is simply a process based on the proof-of-work mechanism. The process of trying different nonce values as input to SHA256 hashing by constantly changing the block header to find a specific format hash value requires a certain number of leading zeros, and the more leading zeros required, the more difficult it is.

## Example

Let's simplify the problem, you can look more intuitively to understand the mining process of finding leading 0's, for example, we want to find the nonce added to the back of 'abc' which can produce 20bits (/256bits) of leading 0's , here we do only one SHA256 operation. We know that the result of SHA256 is a 64-bit hexadecimal string, 1 hexadecimal character is equal to 4 bits, 1 byte is equal to 2 hexadecimal characters, 20 leading zeros means 5 hexadecimal characters are 0, which means we want to get a SHA256 result that starts with "00000". The following is a detailed example.

```python
import hashlib

num_int = 0 #initializing number

#loop to find out the hash
while(True):
  name = "abc" 
  num_str = str(num_int) # turn the number to string
  whole = name + num_str # the name and the number
  result = hashlib.sha256(whole.encode()) # encoding
  str2hex = result.hexdigest() # turn to hex
  if str2hex.startswith('00000'): # find the hash result with 5 leading 0 in hex
    print("The string which's hash has 20 leading zeros:"+whole+" It's hash is:"+str2hex)
  num_int = num_int + 1 # next number
```

We can quickly obtain the following results.

```
The string which's hash has 20 leading zeros:abc767150 It's hash is:00000921a9eae1f5ce832a0bfc6ea51f35afeff2b35289e5d8126ed499ee92a0
The string which's hash has 20 leading zeros:abc942434 It's hash is:00000ce6aa5c218a3d7d69145abe2d8bf7c3e7f3bb2985403c6f3a147082f42c
The string which's hash has 20 leading zeros:abc949116 It's hash is:000003508496ce720bad2927d40c2c17d0827b0eadfb93d325e4a5519e137f83
The string which's hash has 20 leading zeros:abc1122577 It's hash is:0000080d27d9a91dd28772b35e5d609b4e0e9a88774e589c5d9f9831af866950
The string which's hash has 20 leading zeros:abc2280531 It's hash is:00000d58a3e2d78e61c72f1d7638b9fe7685d1f1c19d522eb9049aaa5b231c59
...
```

But what if we want to get a result with 40 leading zeros? Can we still get the result easily?

```python
if str2hex.startswith('0000000000'): # find the hash result with 10 leading 0 in hex
    print("The string which's hash has 40 leading zeros:"+whole+" It's hash is:"+str2hex)
```

We waited for a long time without being able to get the output, which means that the more zeros in front of the hash value required for mining, the more difficult it is to calculate, and 40 leading zeros is almost impossible for a personal computer to get the result.
