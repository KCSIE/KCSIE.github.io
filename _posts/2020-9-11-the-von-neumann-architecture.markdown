describe: What's von Neumann architecture?
---
The von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by Hungarian-American mathematician and physicist John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. That document describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with these components:

A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter
Memory that stores data and instructions
External mass storage
Input and output mechanisms
