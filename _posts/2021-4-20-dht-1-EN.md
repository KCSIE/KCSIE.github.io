# Background

## P2P

### P2P Intro

P2P, also known as peer-to-peer technology, is a peer-to-peer network without a central server that relies on user group nodes for information exchange. Unlike the traditional C/S central server structure, each user node in a P2P network is both a client and a server, and can act as a server to provide services to other nodes. A P2P system is a self-organizing system in which each node is equal and autonomous, aiming to share the use of distributed resources in a network environment that avoids centralized services. One of the most important problems that the network needs to solve is how to find out on which node the resource requested by the user is located. This involves an iteration of P2P technology.

### P2P Stage

The development phase of P2P is accompanied by a shift in the technical architecture. The first generation of P2P is a centralized peer-to-peer network with a centralized topology, where each child node needs to connect to the central server to find the resource since the index information of the file is stored on the central server, e.g. Napster. The second generation of P2P is an unstructured distributed network with a flooding search algorithm, which does not have a central server, e.g. Gnutella. The third generation of P2P is a structured distributed network, based on distributed hash tables.



## DHT

To implement a distributed network in a P2P system or distributed system, two core technologies need to be implemented.

- Topology and content routing
- Content delivery

DHT (Distributed Hash Table) is a distributed storage method proposed in the 1997 MIT paper [*Consistent Hashing and Random Trees：Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web*](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/consistent-hashing-and-random-trees-distributed-caching-protocols-for-relieving-hot-spots-on-the-world-wide-web-technical-publication.pdf). This distributed network does not require a central node server, instead each client is responsible for a small range of routes and for storing a small portion of the data, thus enabling the addressing and storage of the entire DHT network. DHT network also replicates backup redundant information on the nodes closest to the keywords, which avoids the single node failure problem. DHT is used to distribute a collection of key values (Key) to all nodes in the distributed system and can efficiently deliver the information to the only node (Peer) that has the key value provided by the query.

DHT has the following features:

- Decentralized: the nodes that make up the system do not have any centralized coordination mechanism
- Scale: The system should remain efficient even with a large number of nodes
- Fault tolerance: The system must be reliable even if nodes are constantly joining, leaving or stopping.

DHT specifies its own architecture, including Keyspace and Overlay Network, but does not specify the details of the algorithm, so there are many different implementations, such as Chord, Pastry, Kademlia, etc. The DHT in BitTorrent is based on a variation of Kademlia, called Mainline DHT. However, whether it is Chord, Pastry, or Kademlia, the most immediate goal is to locate the desired node as fast as possible. In P2P file sharing applications, the goal is to find the list of peers that are sharing a file/seed as fast as possible.

We will discuss DHT in detail later.



## BitTorrent & IPFS

### BitTorrent

BitTorrent (abbreviated to BT) is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P), which enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet in a decentralized manner. BitTorrent protocol finds users with files other users want and then downloads pieces of the files from those users simultaneously. Consequently, transmission rates are faster than with http and ftp, which both download files sequentially from only one source.

The first release of the BitTorrent client had no search engine and no peer exchange, so users who wanted to upload a file had to create a small torrent descriptor file that they would upload to a torrent index site. The first uploader acted as a seed, and downloaders would initially connect as peers. Those who wish to download the file would download the torrent, which their client would use to connect to a tracker which had a list of the IP addresses of other seeds and peers in the swarm. Once a peer completed a download of the complete file, it could in turn function as a seed.

To solve the Tracker limitation, BitTorrent later uses DHT to store contact information between peers for seeds without Tracker, so that each peer becomes a tracker. However, two points need to be noted:

- A "peer" is a client/server listening on a TCP port that implements the BitTorrent protocol. 
- A "node" is a client/server listening on a UDP port implementing the distributed hash table protocol. 

### IPFS

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed, new hypermedia transport protocol based on content addressing. IPFS supports the creation of fully distributed applications. It is designed to make the network faster, more secure, and more open. IPFS is also a distributed file system, and its goal is to connect all computing devices to the same file system, thus becoming a globally unified storage system. By integrating existing technologies (BitTorrent, DHT/Kademlia, Git, and SFS), the IPFS project seeks to create a faster, more secure, and open next-generation Internet, enabling a global file storage system that is permanently available in the Internet and where data can be stored forever.

IPFS works as follows:

- Each file and all blocks within it are given a unique authentication code called a cryptographic hash.
- IPFS removes duplicate files with the same hash value over the network, and by calculating it is possible to determine which files are redundant duplicates. And the version history of each file is tracked.
- Each network node stores only what it is interested in, as well as some index information that helps figure out who is storing what.
- When looking for a file, you can look up the node storing the changed file in the network by the file's hash value and find the desired file.
- Using what is called IPNS (decentralized naming system), each file can be collaboratively named to an easy-to-read name. By searching, it is easy to find the file you want to view.



# Distributed Hash Table

## From Hash Table to Distributed Hash Table

### Hash Table

A hash table, is a data structure that is accessed directly based on the Key value. That is, it accesses the records by mapping the keycode values to a location in the table to speed up the lookup process. This mapping function is called a hash function, and the array that holds the records is called a hash table. In a data structure like a hash table, it will contain N Buckets. For a specific hash table, N (the number of buckets) is usually fixed, so each bucket can be numbered from 0 to N-1. Buckets are used to store key-value pairs, which can be understood as a dynamic array that can hold multiple key-value pairs.

The process can be briefly described as follows, using Hash Table and Hash Function to map Key and Data (i.e. Value) into a Hash Bucket.

- After the Key passes through the Hash Function, the Bucket position is calculated, and then the Data is stored in the Bucket.
- After that, the Bucket location can be obtained within O(1) by using the same Key.

### DHT

The concept of DHT is to instantiate the above Bucket into individual storage nodes, where the distributed features are reflected.

- The Key is calculated after Hash Function to find out which node the Data should be stored in.
- The requests and data can be distributed to different nodes.

## DHT Detail

The structure of a distributed hash table can be divided into several main components. The basis is an abstract `Keyspace`, for example a collection of all 160-bit long strings. `Keyspace Partitioning` splits the `Keyspace` into several nodes, which are assigned to nodes in this system. The extension network connects these nodes and allows them to find the node that has a value in the `Keyspace` by using any value in the `Keyspace`.

Suppose the `Keyspace` is a 160-bit long string collection. To store a file in a distributed hash table with the name `filename` and the content `data`, we compute the SHA-1 hash of `filename` - a 160-bit `key` - and send the message `put(key,data)` to any participating node in the distributed hash table. This message is routed through the extended network until it reaches the node designated to store the key value `key` in the key space partition. And `(key,data)` is stored in that node. Other nodes simply recompute the hash value `key` of `filename` and submit the message `get(key)` to any participating node in the distributed hash table to find the data associated with `key`. This message is also routed in the extended network to the node responsible for storing `key`. This node is then responsible for passing back the stored `data`.

### Address Management

As mentioned above, in the distributed hash table, each node and resource has a unique identifier, which is usually a 160-bit integer. For convenience, we call the unique identifier of a node ID and the unique identifier of a resource Key, and we can hash the IP address of a node with SHA-1 algorithm to get the ID of the node; similarly, we can hash a resource file with SHA-1 algorithm to get the Key of the resource. Once the ID and Key are defined, the resources can be published and stored. Each node is responsible for a specific range of Keys, and the rules depend on the specific algorithm.

There are two approaches to publishing and requesting resources: one is to transfer the file directly to the responsible node, which stores the file resource; when the resource is requested, the node then transfers the file to the requester. The other approach is that the publisher itself tries to store the resources, and transmits the address of the node where the file is located to the responsible node when publishing the file, and the responsible node stores only one address; when requesting resources, it contacts the responsible node to get the address of the resource file, and then retrieves the resources.

### Routing algorithms

#### Topology Design

DHT is an implementation of a distributed system that necessarily defines some kind of topology and therefore designs the routing algorithm. When a distributed system has its own topology, it becomes an overlay network itself. An overlay network is, in simple terms, a "network on top of a network". For most DHT, they are overlay networks on top of the Internet, and their data communication is dependent on the lower Internet for implementation. The node ID mentioned earlier are reflected in the fact that distributed systems only need to consider the node ID when designing topologies and routing algorithms, without considering the properties of the underlying network (e.g., protocol type, IP address, port number).

#### Routing Algorithm Implementation

First of all each node will be contacted by several other nodes (IP address, port), called routing table. In general a distributed hash table with n nodes has a routing table of O(logn) length. Each node constructs a routing table according to specific rules, and eventually all nodes form a network. A message from a node will gradually approach the target node along the network and finally reach the target node according to the specific routing rules. In a distributed hash table with n nodes, the number of times this process is forwarded is typically O(logn).

#### Distance Algorithm

Some DHT systems also define a distance algorithm to calculate: "distance between nodes", "distance between data", "distance between nodes and data". The "distance" here is logical and corresponds to the topology of the DHT itself, which is independent of the physical geographical location and the topology of the Internet.

### Self-organization

The nodes in the distributed hash table are composed of individual users, who join, leave or fail at any time; and there is no central server for the distributed hash table, which means that the system is completely unmanaged. This means that assigning addresses, constructing routing tables, joining nodes, leaving nodes, and excluding failed nodes all rely on self-organizing policies.

To publish or acquire resources, a node must first join, and there are usually several steps for a node to join. First, a new node needs to contact any existing node in the distributed hash table through some external mechanism. Then the new node constructs its own routing table by requesting this existing node and updates the routing table of other nodes that need to be connected to it. Finally the node also needs to retrieve the resources it is responsible for.
